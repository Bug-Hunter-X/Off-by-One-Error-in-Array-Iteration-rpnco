This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java when iterating over arrays. The bug.java file contains the erroneous code, while bugSolution.java provides the corrected version.  The error occurs due to an incorrect loop condition that tries to access an element beyond the array's valid index range.  This can lead to runtime exceptions and unexpected behavior. The solution shows how to correctly iterate within the bounds of the array.
